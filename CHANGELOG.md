## v0.55.3

## v0.53.6

- Added a warm bottom-up haze gradient above the Level 5 colossus and below the park front parallax layer.

## v0.53.5

## v0.53.4

- Fixed the placeholder colossus rig's vertical skeleton layout so its labeled body parts no longer render upside down.

## v0.53.3

- Added the Level 5 park foreground parallax layer so the distant colossus can render between background and front trees.

## v0.53.2

- Rebuilt the placeholder colossus skeleton into an upright body layout so the labeled head, torso, pelvis, arms, and legs read in the correct places.

## v0.53.1

## v0.53.0

- Replaced the Level 5 rectangle colossus prototype with a Spine-backed skeletal placeholder.
